Thiseio or Thissio (Greek: Θησείο, pronounced [θiˈsio]) is a
traditional neighbourhood in downtown Athens, Greece, northwest of the
Acropolis, 1.5 km southwest of downtown. The name refers to the Temple
of Hephaestus, which was mistakenly known as Thiseion, in reference to
Theseus, the mythical king of Athens.

The area has many cafés and cultural meeting points. Thiseio
is served by the nearby Thiseio metro station.

Exarcheia (Greek: Εξάρχεια pronounced [eˈksaɾ.çi.a]) is a
self-governing anarchist neighbourhood in central Athens, Greece close
to the historical building of the National Technical University of
Athens. The district took its name from a 19th century
businessman named Exarchos (Greek: Έξαρχος) who opened a large general
store there. Exarcheia is bordered on the east by Kolonaki and is
framed by Patission Street, Panepistimiou Street and Alexandras
Avenue. Exarcheia is renowned for being Athens' historical core of
radical political and intellectual activism. Exarcheia is often
considered the anarchist quarter of Athens, known for its radical
democracy.

Kolonaki (Greek: Κολωνάκι, pronounced [koloˈnaci]), literally "Little
Column", is an upscale neighborhood in central Athens, Greece. It is
located on the southern slopes of Lycabettus hill. Its name derives
from the two metre column (located in Kolonaki Square) that defined
the area even before the area's urbanization.

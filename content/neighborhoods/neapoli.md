Neapoli (Greek: Νεάπολη pronounced [neˈa.po.li]) is a neighborhood of
Athens, Greece. It is located on the northern slope of Mount
Lycabettus.

Neapoli means 'new city.' The name originally comes from the fact that
it was a new area of Athens built beyond Praxitelous and Evripidou
streets during the decades when the city was starting to become
urbanised. Eventually, the name Neapoli came to refer to only the
eastern side, while the western side became known as
Metaxourgeio. Neapoli was built in the mid 19th century by
constructors, plasterers and marble constructors who came in Athens
searching for a better life. The land there was then outside the
zoning area and consequently cheaper.

The area is well known for book publishing and some of the oldest
bookstores of Athens are found there.
